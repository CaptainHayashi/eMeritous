Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.     
A place of limitless power. Those that seek to
control such a utopia will soon bring an end        
to themselves.                       

Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him,
PSI user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus
Dome in search of answers.


INSTALLATION:

- Compile with the Makefile (change CC to your preferred C compiler.)

- Make install is not ready yet, but should be in later builds.

If the game is too difficult for you, you can play in 'Wuss mode' for
a far more sombre gaming experience.


BASIC CONTROLS:

Arrow keys - Move around. To walk through doors, simply walk up to
             them and push against them.

Space      - Charge your PSI circuit for attacking.

Escape     - Exit the game.

H          - View the help file.

Tab        - View the map (you can then use the arrow keys to scroll
             around the map.

Enter      - Activate a trigger tile that you are standing on.
             Enter is also used for various other things, such as
             for reading in-game dialogue.
             
P          - Pause the game.

Anything relating to the original Meritous should NOT go to me, but to 
Lancer-X/ASCEAI. (The converse applies for eMeritous peculiarities)


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Thanks to the Meritous beta testers: Quasar, Terryn and Wervyn, for their hard 
work in assisting in keeping Meritous fairly stable.
